# Upscale by CVSYS

Welcome to Upscale, a CVSYS project.

## [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cvsys/upscale)

Please be respectful and **DO NOT upload videos longer than 15 seconds**. Because it is running on a FREE HF Space, expect HOURS (literally - around 3 hours...) to process 5 minutes.

It takes over 20 minutes to upscale a 16-frame video!!

## Support

Upscale by CVSYS supports:

 * CPU inference
 * CUDA GPU inference
 * MPS GPU (Apple Silicon) inference

## Requirements

 * Python >= 3.10
 * A GPU is not required, but will significantly speed up inference.
